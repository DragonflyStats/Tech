Revolution Analytics
Revolution R Enterprise Breaks Through R’s Memory Barrier for Big Data Analysis
Revolution Analytics has taken the popular R language to unprecedented new levels of capacity and performance for statistical analysis of very large data sets. Using the built-in RevoScaleR package, R users can process, visualize and model terabyte-class data sets in a fraction of the time of legacy products – without requiring expensive or specialized hardware.
Big-Data statistical algorithms make use of all available computing resources for high-performance analysis, without data size limitations. Revolution R Enterprise includes distributed, multi-threaded implementations of the following algorithms, with more planned for future updates: •Summary Statistics
 
•Crosstabulations
•Correlation and Covariance
•Linear Regression
•Binomial Logistic Regression
•Principal Components Analysis
•Generalized Linear Modeling
•K-means clustering 
•Predictions
