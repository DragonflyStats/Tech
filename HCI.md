Human Computer Interface
Goals

A basic goal of HCI is to improve the interactions between users and computers by making computers more usable and receptive to the user's needs. Specifically, HCI is concerned with:
methodologies and processes for designing interfaces (i.e., given a task and a class of users, design the best possible interface within given constraints, optimizing for a desired property such as learnability or efficiency of use)
methods for implementing interfaces (e.g. software toolkits and libraries; efficient algorithms)
techniques for evaluating and comparing interfaces
developing new interfaces and interaction techniques
developing descriptive and predictive models and theories of interaction

A long term goal of HCI is to design systems that minimize the barrier between the human's cognitive model of what they want to accomplish and the computer's understanding of the user's task.

Professional practitioners in HCI are usually designers concerned with the practical application of design methodologies to real-world problems. Their work often revolves around designing graphical user interfaces and web interfaces.


Researchers in HCI are interested in developing new design methodologies, experimenting with new hardware devices, prototyping new software systems, exploring new paradigms for interaction, and developing models and theories of interaction.

Human–computer interaction (HCI) 
Human–computer interaction (HCI) is the study of interaction between people (users) and computers. It is often regarded as the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, design and several other fields of study. Interaction between users and computers occurs at the user interface (or simply interface), which includes both software and hardware, for example, general-purpose computer peripherals and large-scale mechanical systems, such as aircraft and power plants. The following definition is given by the Association for Computing Machinery[1]:
"Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them." 
Because human-computer interaction studies a human and a machine in conjunction, it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side. On the machine side, techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages, and development environments are relevant. On the human side, communication theory, graphic and industrial design disciplines, linguistics, social sciences, cognitive psychology, and human performance are relevant. Engineering and design methods are also relevant. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of HCI, people with different backgrounds contribute to its success. HCI is also sometimes referred to as man–machine interaction (MMI) or computer–human interaction (CHI).
Human processor model 
Human processor model is a cognitive modeling method used to calculate how long it takes to perform a certain task. Other cognitive modeling methods include parallel design, GOMS, and KLM (human-computer interaction). Cognitive modeling methods are one way to evaluate the usability of a product. This method uses experimental times to calculate cognitive and motor processing time. The value of the human processor model is that it allows a system designer to predict the performance with respect to time it takes a person to complete a task without performing experiments. Other modeling methods include inspection methods, inquiry methods, prototyping methods, and testing methods.
The human processor model uses the cognitive, perceptual, and motor processors along with the visual image, working memory, and long term memory storages. A diagram is shown below. Each processor has a cycle time and each memory has a decay time. These values are also included below. By following the connections diagrammed below, along with the associated cycle or decay times, the time it takes a user to perform a certain task can be calculated. Studies into this field were initially done by Card, S.K., Moran T.P., & Newell, A. Current studies in the field include work to distinguish process times in older adults by Tiffany Jastrembski and Neil Charness (2007).
 



HCI task analysis techniques
GOMS - Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules
KLM - Keystroke-Level Model
TAKD - Task analysis for knowledge descriptions
HTA - HIERARCHICAL TASK ANALYSIS 
Keystroke-Level Model, sometimes referred to as KLM or KLM-GOMS, is a hard science approach to human–computer interaction (HCI), based on CMN-GOMS, developed by Card, Moran, and Newell, and spelled out in their book The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction, 1983. The Keystroke-Level Model is an 11-step method that can be used by individuals or companies seeking ways to estimate the time it takes to complete simple data input tasks using a computer and mouse. By using KLM-GOMS, individuals often find more efficient or better ways to complete a task simply by analyzing the steps required in the process and rearranging or eliminating unneeded steps.
HIERARCHICAL TASK ANALYSIS 
Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) was introduced by Annett and Duncan (1967) to evaluate an organization’s training needs. The underlying technique, hierarchical decomposition (Annett, Duncan, Stammers and Gray, 1971), analyzes and represents the behavioral aspects of complex tasks such as planning, diagnosis and decision making (Annett and Stanton, 2001). HTA breaks tasks into subtasks and operations or actions. These task components are then graphically represented using a structure chart. HTA entails identifying tasks, categorizing them, identifying the subtasks, and checking the overall accuracy of the model. 
HTA is useful for interface designers because it provides a model for task execution, enabling designers to envision the goals, tasks, subtasks, operations, and plans essential to users’ activities. HTA is useful for decomposing complex tasks, but has a narrow view of the task, and normally is used in conjunction with other methods of task analysis to increase its effectiveness. HTA serves as both an analytical framework and a practical tool for designers.

Evaluation
A heuristic evaluation is a discount usability inspection method for computer software that helps to identify usability problems in the user interface (UI) design. It specifically involves evaluators examining the interface and judging its compliance with recognized usability principles (the "heuristics"). 
Evaluators assess the interface against a set of heuristics, usually from the following set by Nielsen and Molich; use simple and natural dialogue; speak the user’s
language; minimise user memory load; are consistent; provide
feedback; provide clearly marked exits; provide shortcuts; provide good error messages and prevent errors.
These evaluation methods are now widely taught and practiced in the New Media sector, where UIs are often designed in a short space of time on a budget that may restrict the amount of money available to provide for other types of interface testing. 
‘Cognitive walkthrough’ – a discount usability approach to evaluation,
or an approach that is assumed to be usable by HCI specialists,
designers, etc. and does not involve end users. HCI specialists or
designers walkthrough the interface answering a set of questions
relating to how the user can make progress towards their goal and how
they assess that progress. The theory known as CE+ has a number of
components which give rise to the set of nine questions which govern
the procedure of the walkthrough. One of the problems with the CW is
that it is very tedious to apply in that every action the evaluator takes
has to be assessed and recorded and evaluators often give up on filling
in forms and assessing the granularity of actions but, instead, change
instead to assessing procedures.

• ‘Empirical evaluation’ – a technique which involves assessing interfaces
with the help of users, therefore data is gathered and analysed on the
actual use of the system by users chosen to be representative of those
for whom the system was designed. Survey methods such as questionnaires, protocols (CP and RP), observations etc. are often used.

Wizard of Oz experiment 
In the field of human-computer interaction, a Wizard of Oz experiment is a research experiment in which subjects interact with a computer system that subjects believe to be autonomous, but which is actually being operated or partially operated by an unseen human being.
