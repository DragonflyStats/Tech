\section*{Prediction with Logistic Regression}
In this example, we take a dataset of labels and feature vectors. We learn to predict the labels from feature vectors using the Logistic Regression algorithm.

Python
Scala
Java
\begin{verbatim}
# Every record of this DataFrame contains the label and
# features represented by a vector.
df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(data, ["label", "features"])

# Set parameters for the algorithm.
# Here, we limit the number of iterations to 10.
lr = LogisticRegression(maxIter=10)

# Fit the model to the data.
model = lr.fit(df)

# Given a dataset, predict each point's label, and show the results.
model.transform(df).show()
\end{verbatim}
