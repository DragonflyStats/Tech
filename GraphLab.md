GraphLab
==============
GraphLab is a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++. The GraphLab project started by Prof. Carlos Guestrin of Carnegie Mellon University in 2009. It is an open source project using Apache License. While GraphLab was originally developed for Machine Learning tasks, it has found great success at a broad range of other data-mining tasks; out-performing other abstractions by orders of magnitude.


Main features of GraphLab are:

- A unified multicore and distributed API: write once run efficiently in both shared and distributed memory systems
- Tuned for performance: optimized C++ execution engine leverages extensive multi-threading and asynchronous IO
- Scalable: GraphLab intelligently places data and computation using sophisticated new algorithms
- HDFS Integration
- Powerful Machine Learning Toolkits
