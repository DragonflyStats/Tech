GraphLab is a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++. The GraphLab project started by Prof. Carlos Guestrin of Carnegie Mellon University in 2009. It is an open source project using Apache License. While GraphLab was originally developed for Machine Learning tasks, it has found great success at a broad range of other data-mining tasks; out-performing other abstractions by orders of magnitude.
