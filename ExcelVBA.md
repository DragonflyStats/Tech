Excel VBA
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet application that provides simple to advanced means of creating and managing any type of list. To enhance it beyond its default function, it ships with a language called Microsoft Visual Basic or simply Visual Basic.
Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a computer language based on Microsoft Visual Basic. It allows you to write code that can automatically perform actions on a document and/or its content. When using that language, you write pieces of code, using an external environment.
Microsoft Visual Basic is a programming environment that gets automatically installed when you setup Microsoft Excel. It stays apart because most people would not need or use it. This means that, if you want to use the Microsoft Visual Basic programming environment that ships with Microsoft Excel, you must ask for it, which can be easily done.
To implement functionality beyond a regular spreadsheet, a Microsoft Visual Basic programming environment is installed with Microsoft Office Excel 2007. The computer language used is Visual Basic for Application (VBA).

Procedures, Functions and Sub-procedures

A procedure is a section of code created to carry an assignment, separate from a spreadsheet, whose action can be used to complement a spreasheet. You create the procedure by writing code. One of the advantages of a procedure is that, once it exists, you can access it when necessary and as many times as you want.

There are two categories of procedures you will use in your spreadsheets: those that are already installed with Microsoft Excel and those you will create.

In the Visual Basic language, like most other languages, there are two types of procedures: functions and sub procedures.

A sub procedure is an assignment that is carried but does not give back a result. To create a sub procedure, start with the Sub keyword followed by a name (like everything else, a procedure must have a name). The name of a procedure is always followed by parentheses. At the end of the sub procedure, you must type End Sub.
