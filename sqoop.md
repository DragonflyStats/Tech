Sqoop
========
- Sqoop is a command-line interface application for transferring data between relational databases and Hadoop.
- It supports incremental loads of a single table or a free form SQL query as well as saved jobs which can be run multiple times to import updates made to a database since the last import. 
- Imports can also be used to populate tables in Hive or HBase.
- Exports can be used to put data from Hadoop into a relational database. 
- Sqoop became a top-level Apache project in March 2012.
- Microsoft uses a Sqoop-based connector to help transfer data from Microsoft SQL Server databases to Hadoop.
- ouchbase, Inc. also provides a Couchbase Server-Hadoop connector by means of Sqoop.


<hr>
Apache Sqoop is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases. Sqoop imports data from external structured datastores into HDFS or related systems like Hive and HBase. Sqoop can also be used to extract data from Hadoop and export it to external structured datastores such as relational databases and enterprise data warehouses. Sqoop works with relational databases such as: Teradata, Netezza, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, and HSQLDB
